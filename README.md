# LKIntuneFunctions

PowerShell module for Microsoft Intune administration via the Microsoft Graph API. Built to simplify bulk policy management, assignment auditing, and day-to-day Intune operations.

## Features

- **Policy Management** - Query, rename, and inspect policies across 15 policy types (Settings Catalog, Compliance, Endpoint Security, Platform Scripts, Apps, and more)
- **Assignment Operations** - Add, remove, and copy group assignments and exclusions across policies, with scope mismatch protection
- **Assignment Auditing** - Detect mismatched assignments (e.g., user-scoped policies assigned to device groups) across your entire tenant
- **Group Operations** - Create, rename, delete groups; manage members; reverse-lookup which policies target a group
- **Device & User Lookups** - Query devices and users, view detailed device info, trigger remote actions (Sync, Restart, Wipe)
- **Scope Resolution** - Automatically resolves policy scope (User/Device) via Graph metadata for accurate mismatch detection
